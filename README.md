# search-n-sketch

NOTE: This application will not run locally without a locally stored Unsplash API key. This API key should be stored in a ./config.js which is configured as such:

let config = {
MY_UNSPLASH_KEY: "insertKeyHere"
}

Search-n-Sketch will be an application for new artists to quickly find reference photos and be able to create timed drawing sessions with a selection of references from their search in order to learn how to quickly (or carefully) sketch subjects of any type. It will foremost be a learning tool but may evolve into a "daily practice" type application.
